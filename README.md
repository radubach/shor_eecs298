# Shor's Algorithm ‚Äì Group Project

This repository is for our group project on **Shor‚Äôs Algorithm** for our quantum computing class EECS298 Spring 2025.

## üß† Project Overview

Shor‚Äôs algorithm is a quantum algorithm that efficiently factors large integers‚Äîsomething classical algorithms struggle with. Our goals include:

- Understanding the math behind Shor's algorithm
- Implementing it using Python and Qiskit (or another framework)
- Demonstrating it on small numbers (e.g., factoring 15 into 3 √ó 5)
- Explaining its implications for cryptography

- Focused on factoring \( N = 15 \) with \( a = 7 \)
- Builds and compares quantum circuits using different methods
- Simulates both **ideal** and **noisy** hardware
- Demonstrates tradeoffs between circuit complexity and error rates

- Generalizes Shor‚Äôs algorithm to factor arbitrary values of \( N \)
- Explores challenges when scaling beyond \( N = 15 \)
- Demonstrates circuit depth and qubit limitations
- Runs only on ideal simulators due to size and noise sensitivity
